# Feature Development Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for developing new features in this project.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Feature Specification Generation
When you request a new feature, I will:
- Generate a markdown file named `feature-specs/[feature-name].md`
- Include comprehensive specifications following the template below
- Wait for your review and approval before implementation

### 2. Review and Refinement
You will:
- Review the generated feature specification
- Modify requirements, tasks, or integration details as needed
- Approve the final specification

### 3. Implementation
Once approved, I will:
- Use the TodoWrite tool to track implementation progress
- Implement the feature according to the approved specification
- Follow the project's existing patterns and conventions

## Feature Specification Template

Each feature specification will include:

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this feature does and why it's needed.

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- Additional user stories as needed

## Technical Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Specific functionality that must be implemented
- User interactions and expected behaviors
- Data requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements
- Accessibility needs

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Description
- [ ] Task 2: Description
- [ ] Task 3: Description
- [ ] Testing and validation

## Integration Points
### API Integrations
- External APIs that need to be integrated
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing components or utilities to leverage
- New shared components to create
- Database schema changes (if applicable)

## Documentation Requirements
- User documentation needed
- Developer documentation
- API documentation updates

## Design Considerations
- UI/UX requirements
- Responsive design needs
- Accessibility considerations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests required
- Integration tests needed
- User acceptance criteria

## Deployment Notes
- Environment variables needed
- Configuration changes required
- Migration steps (if applicable)
```

## File Organization

Project documentation structure:
```
docs/
└── workflow/                  # Workflow and process documentation
    └── FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md    # This file

feature-specs/
├── [feature-name].md          # Feature specifications awaiting approval
└── implemented/               # Completed features for reference
    └── [feature-name].md
```

## Example Usage

1. **You say**: "I want to add real-time deployment notifications"
2. **I create**: `feature-specs/real-time-notifications.md` with full specification
3. **You review**: Modify the specification as needed
4. **You approve**: "Please implement this feature"
5. **I implement**: Following the approved specification with progress tracking
